/**This data structure is a list that is partitioned into continuous segments.
 * Each segment can contain any number of elements (including 0).
 *
 * You can't remove elements at an arbitrary index. It's only possible to remove all elements in the last segment.
 * This is intentionally similar to a stack. For this reason, this data-structure can also be interpreted as stack,
 * whose individual elements are lists (but this "stack" supports some further operations like continuous indexing,
 * that's why we have it).
 *
 * The example ((1, 2), (4), (), (6, 5, 4)) contains 4 segments. The first segment is (1, 2), the second segment
 * is (4), the third element is the empty list ( ) and the fourth segment is (6, 5, 4).
 * The indexing is continuous, meaning that the entry at index *4* in the example is 5.
 * Reading of entries at an arbitrary index is allowed, which is not a regular property of a stack.
 *
 * Additionally, it tracks the frequency of the elements in a [HashMap]. Therefore, the method [contains] has a constant runtime.
 *
 *
 * In the case of this project, it is used to track information related to the search-tree in the algorithm, mostly
 * for each vertex in the subgraph what its exclusive neighbours are (neighbours first discovered by this vertex).
 * The continuous indexing is needed so that you can iterate through the neighbours with pointers. The method [contains]
 * is needed frequently to check which neighbours of a vertex are *exclusive* (not already discovered, so not in the [SegmentedList] yet).
 *
 * @param T The type of the elements stored in this object.*/
